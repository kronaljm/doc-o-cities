nothing much this update, just the addition of the calculator.<br>
it also redirects going from the neocities link, sorry; this is easiest and fastest to edit for me.<br>
i *am* learning a lot of github too.<br>
i can edit the entire thing into one update, rather than having 35 edits total like previous endeavors on here.

<h1>calculator update</h1>  
self-explanatory.<br>
added calculator link, and fixed whatever shenanigans i found.<br>
also, story demonstration is available to see on mobile :))<br>


<h2>future stuff</h2>
i plan to add/remake a lot of the website, as this would serve as a hub for most of my projects.<br>
here are some stuff i plan to make, not in any order:<br><br>

- [ ] making the actual hub much better looking<br>
- [ ] dates on links<br>
- [ ] mouse cursor changes<br>
- [ ] less blocks of text<br>
- [ ] file & folder better management<br>
- [ ] spacing on ascii art for story demonstration<br>
- [ ] wizards tower slower fade<br>
- [ ] complete mobile compatability for the entire site<br><br>

- [ ] expurgated ;)
